    We like open technologies, and therefore use
    the <lift:OpenID.link>OpenID</lift:OpenID.link>
    user authorization system. If you want to log in on this site, please
    get an OpenID account from a provider. You most likely already have
    an OpenID account if you use some of the big social media sites
    (get more information <a href="http://openid.net/get/">here</a>); otherwise,
    you can get an OpenID from for example <a href="http://www.myopenid.com/">myOpenID</a><br/>
    (<em>note</em>: do some research, myOpenID might not be the best solution for you).
