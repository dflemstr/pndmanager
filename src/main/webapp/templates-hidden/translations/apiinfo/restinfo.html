    The <lift:Application.name/> supports REST-communication, and thus can
    be communicated with using that standard. If you want to use the
    <lift:Application.name/> API, you just have to download
    (meaning: send a HTTP GET request to) the
    <a href="/api/repository.xml"><lift:Application.name/> API repository file</a>
    whenever you need information about the packages that the <lift:Application.name/>
    manages. This file contains basic information about all the packages in the system.
    If you need even more information about a package than what can be
    acquired through the repository file, locate that package within the
    repository file, and follow the link contained in the "&lt;details&gt;"
    tag for that package entry. This link points to a file containing
    detailed information about the package, including its complete and
    untouched PXML file.
